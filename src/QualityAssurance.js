							<h2>Integrate professional support services within and across NAVSEA or the Virtual SYSCOM to institute best practices throughout and realize cost savings</h2>
							<p>Spectrum Technology Group, Inc. is a Small Business, but growth-oriented and dynamic company of professionals who provide specialized services to the U.S. Navy in scientific, engineering, technical, analytical and programmatic areas. Spectrum Technology has a readiness to comply, with the adaptability and diversity to place personnel on-site in the government environment to provide high-quality support. The company is innovative and versatile, responding quickly to our customers in their evolving program and personnel requirements. Spectrum Technology has a well demonstrated and documented corporate history of being a very cost efficient company from proposal through order completion.</p>
							<p>Founded in 1999, Spectrum Technology Group, Inc. is a consortium of engineering professionals and management experts, drawing on decades of experience, intent on maximizing performance and innovation to develop and support Navy initiatives. Our work to date has been for the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division (NSWCCD). Most of our current work is accomplished as a subcontractor to ManTech Systems Engineering Corporation, under IDIQ task orders on contracts N00167-04-D-0022 and N00167-00-D-0110, addressing critical U.S. Navy requirements in the "Health and Stealth" arena for submarines and surface ships.</p>
						</li>

							<h2>Capability to manage the effort and the team</h2>
							<p>Mr. Dennis L. Leland, president and founder of Spectrum Technology Group, Inc., is a unique key individual. He has a strong resume in both technical (submarine acoustic analysis expert) and administrative (Branch Head, Signatures Performance Evaluation Assessment) arenas, as well as an M.S. degree in technology management and 40 years experience. Mr. Leland will be actively involved on both the technical and managerial levels. He will be the direct point of contact for the Navy, with the responsibility and authority to commit or obtain any and all necessary company resources. He will be singly answerable to the NSWCCD contracting officer.</p>
							<p>The assembled team is an accomplished group of highly knowledgeable and high performing individuals, with tremendous depth, experience and expertise. All personnel assigned to this effort will be kept fully aware of the scientific and engineering issues under consideration with efforts focused toward successful task completion. Spectrum Technology will be organized in a flexible and efficient manner to provide the Navy with results.</p>
							<p>Task planning efforts will be initiated when the NSWCCD Contracting Officer issues a formal request for quote and/or an acceptance of a unilateral delivery order. The Spectrum Point of Contact will review the delivery order requirements and verify with the COR, within one week of the request, that all elements of the task are understood. Spectrum's POC will assess the task objectives, prepare a task implementation plan, and assign a task leader to implement the plan. The plan will identify the technical and management approaches to be utilized to ensure that the required deliverables can be provided when specified. The plan will determine the following:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Specific work elements required to be accomplished</li>
								<li>Time required to complete specific work elements</li>
								<li>Labor mix and number of personnel needed to accomplish the task</li>
								<li>Level of effort for proposed personnel</li>
								<li>Additional resource needs, for example, travel, material and data/information.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h2>Manage change to preserve stability and maintain technical expertise in the workforce</h2>
							<p>Spectrum Technology Group, Inc. will establish, and hold open and frequent communications with NSWCCD personnel, to maintain full awareness of evolving technical issues. Efforts will be focused or re-focused for successful task completion. Participation in planning sessions, Preliminary/Critical Design or Program Status Reviews is necessary and expected; as is being proactive to tasking requirements, their implementation and in meeting customer needs.</p>
							<p>A key to managing change is to understand the change in terms of its impact on cost, schedule and performance; to have a complete understanding of the requirements and the resources necessary to achieve successful performance. Spectrum will provide full support to mitigate any change that negatively impacts the work.</p>
							<p>Work assignments, uniquely crafted to a functional area and derived from the government Statement of Work on each Task Order, will involve all pertinent program personnel and required resources, and will be written such that specific work outcomes remain essential, realistic and achievable. The team leader will be responsible for knowing what is required by the government, and providing direction and guidance to get it accomplished. Actions will be taken to keep key people and an appropriately qualified mix of labor to assure proper and timely task order execution. Recruiting of fresh college or veteran talent, along with taking advantage of the availability of senior personnel making career changes, is a management practice of Spectrum Technology.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h2>Monitor and maximize quality</h2>
							<p>Spectrum Technology Group, Inc. will apply and follow strict quality assurance standards to ensure the highest quality of data submitted and services performed under this contract. Mr. Leland will verify that project personnel understand the project requirements. He will insure that all personnel are working together in order to accomplish the task order objectives.</p>
							<p>Spectrum Technology is customer focused and Fleet support oriented. Our employees pride themselves on providing dependable, timely results and innovative solutions, coupled with ingenuity and exceptional customer support. Our technical products and services consistently exceed government specifications in all project areas, and are provided on budget, and on time or ahead of schedule.</p>
							<p>The task implementation plan will be used to develop a cost estimate (or concurrence) which will be discussed with the Contracting Officer. The Program Director will finalize the designated cost of each delivery order with the Contracting Officer. After receipt of the signed delivery order, task performance will proceed in accordance with the implementation plan. These procedures will be followed for every task issued throughout the contract period. This will ensure that the appropriate action is ALWAYS initiated in a timely manner, that the program is properly directed, and that NSWCCD is properly informed of program status on a task to task basis.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h2>Guarantee responsiveness to and cooperation with customers</h2>
							<p>Spectrum Technology Group, Inc. has established methods in place for monitoring overall project performance and controlling costs to insure timely submission of contract deliverables and quality outputs. A task implementation plan will be developed that provides for pre-determined technical progress and a financial schedule for each deliverable. Progress, expenditures, and delivery schedules will be reviewed and evaluated. Cost control and schedule management will receive priority attention and Spectrum Technology will provide monthly technical and financial progress reports. Comparisons will be made between planned expenditures, resources allocated, and project workload.</p>
							<p>Spectrum will work with the Government to share recommendations regarding the best and most cost-effective and innovative ways to fulfill the Navy's mission.</p>
							<p>A task milestone chart will be updated periodically throughout the period of performance and frequent evaluation of procedures and deliverables will be made. Performance should be and will be made measurable to the greatest extent practicable. Spectrum Technology understands that periodic communication with the Navy is vital to the success of technical projects and meeting the obligation to fulfill contractual requirements.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h2>Problem resolution</h2>
							<p>Frequent communication and technical competence are the keys to early recognition of potential problem areas. Scheduling, technical and/or financial problems are usually found by being aware of deviations from a plan. Unbalanced hours, expenditures that are too high or too low, and missed deadlines indicate a problem that needs to be addressed right away. Possible solutions and their consequences will be fully explored.</p>
							<p>Spectrum Technology Group, Inc. understands the authority of the Government personnel and will reach a mutual understanding in resolving issues at the working level.</p>
							<p>Mr. Leland has the overall responsibility for supervision and task execution. Problem resolution will receive his priority attention, and he will approach conflicts with all company resources to bring the situation under control. The focus will be on insight into the problem and an outcome, not the rote process.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h2>Flow down of incentives to team partners</h2>
							<p>Spectrum Technology Group, Inc. is proposing sharing any cost savings with our team partners. Our maximum pass through rate is 8%, and we will lower it for stream-lined project management from our team partners. If in the Award Term Options periods, we enter into any future task orders with incentives attached, we will appropriately flow down these incentives to the Team involved who maximizes our performance.</p>
