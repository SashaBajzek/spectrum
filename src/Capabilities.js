				<h1>Research</h1>
					<p>
						Spectrum Technology Group, Inc. works closely with the Navy research and development efforts and as such has high quality research resources at its disposal as well as the knowledge and experience to back up those resources with a solid grounding in many areas of the sciences and engineering. Before any project can begin the background information is researched and explored to get a better understanding of what advancements have been made in the area of the project and what is needed to make the product work with the best results. Research is a very important part of the development process because it allows for the exploration into proven results and concepts as well as the discovery of new methods of solving problems that may have never been tried before.
