						<li>
							<p>A. Contract Number: N65236-02-D-6822; Prime</p>
							<p>Contract Title: SPAWAR CWITT Support</p>
							<p>Contracting Activity: SPAWAR Code 2877</p>
							<p>Contact Type: IDIQ</p>
							<p>POC: A. Smith, Code 2877</p>
							<p>Phone Number: (757)-558-6849</p>
							<p>Total Contract Value: Period of Performance: $9,727,979; 1/2002-7/2007</p>
							<p>Description of Work Performed: Progeny Systems provides engineering and technical support to SPAWAR Code 2877 for the Non-Propulsion Electronics System (NPES) test and integration effort for VIRGINIA Class new construction Technical Evaluation (TechEval), Operational Evaluation (OpEval), and certification processes for the Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I) systems. Provided support for the System Interface Integration Testing (SIIT) and System Interface Operability Testing (SIOT) in the Command and Control Subsystem Off-Hull Assembly Test Site (COATS) at General Dynamics. Authored, evaluated and conducted consolidated test procedures for the Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence System and Weapons Shipping, Handling, Launching Integrated Test Team (CWITT) and Weapons System Accuracy Trials (WSAT). Developed test fixtures and analysis software used in the validation of subsystems/systems. Supported CWITT testing processes including: Development and tracking of Problem Trouble Reports (PTRs); resolution of PTRs; regression testing; development of test metrics; and development and maintenance of configuration management during testing.</p>

							<p>B. Contract Number: N00024-03-C-6219; Prime</p>
							<p>Contract Title: Engineering & Technical Services for AN/WLY-1</p>
							<p>Contracting Activity: NAVSEA PMS401</p>
							<p>Contact Type: IDIQ</p>
							<p>POC: J. VanAllman</p>
							<p>Phone Number: (202)-781-3501</p>
							<p>Total Contract Value: Period of Performance: $31,571,494; 8/2003-12/2008</p>
							<p>Description of Work Performed: The Active Intercept and Ranging (AI&R) system, designed and manufactured by Progeny Systems, is a fully integrated acoustic intercept processor for use within the Acoustic-Rapid COTS insertion (A-RCI) SONAR System installed on SSN 688, SSN 688I, SSN 21, and SSBN/SSGN Class platforms. Developed as an off-shoot of the VIRGINIA Class submarine AN/WLY-1( ) subsystem technology insertion effort, AI&R provides a technology insertion path for future acoustic intercept signal processing and sensors enhancements that replaces the current AN/WLR-9 capabilities on all SSN Class submarines. Constructed entirely of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components, the AI&R System is able to support any Grade-A military shipboard application. Developed with total ownership cost reductions in mind, the AN/WLY-1( ) and AI&R Systems provide a significant reduction in life-cycle cost, greater system performance, increased reliability, and future technology insertion opportunities. Required development of government furnished data products (ICDs, outline drawings, wiring tables, etc.) manufacturing jigs and tools, factory level acceptance test procedures, and development of integrated logistics products (IETM, computer based training (CBT) courseware, maintenance requirement cards, etc.).</p>

							<p>C. Contract Number: N00024-06-C-6238; Prime</p>
							<p>Contract Title: Common Weapon Launcher </p>
							<p>Contracting Activity: NAVSEA PMS425</p>
							<p>Contact Type: IDIQ</p>
							<p>POC: R. Jackson</p>
							<p>Phone Number: (202) 781-3428</p>
							<p>Total Contract Value: Period of Performance: $3,271,538; 10/2005-10/2010</p>
							<p>Description of Work Performed: This contract represents the first incremental effort in the Full Scale Engineering Development of a Common Navy Weapon Launch System (CWL). The existing contract period of performance is being extended to 2010 with scope being increased to include development completion (estimated at approx. $ 25M) and production of approximately 30 CWL units (approx $ 3.5M each). These systems will automate, consolidate and modernize existing submarine weapon launch systems for launching ADCAP torpedoes and Tomahawk Cruise Missiles, reducing time from target acquisition to time-of-fire while reducing manning and program life cycle costs. Developed with total ownership cost reductions in mind, the CWL System provides a significant reduction in life-cycle cost, greater system performance, increased reliability, and future technology insertion opportunities. Required development of government furnished data products (ICDs, outline drawings, wiring tables, etc.) manufacturing jigs and tools, factory level acceptance test procedures, and development of integrated logistics products (IETM, computer based training (CBT) courseware, maintenance requirement cards, etc.).</p>
