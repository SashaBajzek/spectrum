					<h1>Our People</h1>

					<p>
						Spectrum Technology Group, Inc. is at present a very small company of under 30 people competing against the nation's biggest and most well-known companies for contracts. In light of this Spectrum Technology has been very successful in the past at getting contracts and maintaining them for its size. This is because of our people. Spectrum is made of up talented, hardworking, and creative people from many diverse backgrounds and age groups. Because of this diversity each person can bring different skills and talents together to benefit the company as a whole and allow the company to tackle many different problems and contracts cheaply and efficiently.

						Spectrum Technology is a relatively young company having been founded in 1999 by President Mr. Dennis Leland, after he had completed 30 years of work for the U.S. Government on critical Navy programs primarily the Acoustic Trials program at the NSWCCD. His experience led him to see an opportunity in his specialty of Acoustic Engineering and Analysis. Starting as a one man operation Spectrum Technology Group, Inc. soon began to expand and as the company grew so did its reputation for good service by great people. This idea is a very important one for Spectrum Technology and continues to be one of its biggest selling points.
